-- Purpose: Top 10 player career-high scoring games (regular season since 2000) with date + opponent.
-- Inputs: PlayerStatistics, Games
-- Techniques: CTEs, window functions (ROW_NUMBER), CASE, quality filter (games_played >= 100)
-- Notes: Opponent derived via home/away; ties resolved to earliest date.
